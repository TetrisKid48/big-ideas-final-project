    "#### Alex - Traffic Signs\n",
    "Alex used this dataset to count the total number of traffic signs in each neighborhood that you have to react to while driving. These slow down drivers as they have to read the signs to continue.\n",
    "#### Rory - Parking Meters\n",
    "Rory found which neighborhoods have the highest parking prices, making driving to these areas more expensive.\n",
    "#### Eli - Speed Humps & Traffic Speeds\n",
    "Eli first counts the number of speed bumps in each neighborhood, which limits drivers' speed. Second, he shows which neighborhoods have the most roads where drivers went slower than the speed limit, showing anti-drivability in action."

    "#### Eli\n",
    "Although it's hard for me to pick a favorite neighborhood, I expected Lawrenceville to be the best according to the data. However, Squirrel Hill definitely pulls ahead. It had the most speed bumps by far and much more of the significant traffic signs. These datasets don't account for everything, in my experience Squirrel Hill can also be hard to drive in because of brick roads and pedestrian-first areas.\n",
    "#### Alex\n",
    "I originally thought that a neighborhood like Oakland would be the best in terms of anti-drivability, however with the data I collected and personal experience having lived in Pittsburgh all of my life, I decided between Bloomfield, South Side Flats, and Squirrel Hill, which takes the title of the best neighborhood for me.\n",
    "#### Rory\n",
    "I expected downtown to be the worst in the metrics because parking there is really expensive in addition to the heavy traffic I always experience. However the data showed that on average, Squirrel Hill had the worst driving according to the metrics. Personally I fell Shadyside is the worst to drive in because the roads intersect in confusing ways."
